## 🚀 What is the HR AI Agent?

The **HR AI Agent** is a cutting-edge conversational assistant built using AI and multi-agent collaboration. It helps employees and stakeholders at **BMV System Integration (BMVSI)** get quick, accurate answers to:

- 📌 **Company HR Policies**
- 💸 **Finance-Related Queries**

Built with [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and Google’s [Gemini AI](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/), this solution transforms internal operations by reducing email back-and-forths and manual HR support.

- This ensures continuous **policy improvement and documentation**.

### 📂 Google Drive Integration
- Agents reference company-approved documents from a dedicated **Google Drive folder** (`BMVSI_HR_POLICIES`) for accuracy and compliance.
